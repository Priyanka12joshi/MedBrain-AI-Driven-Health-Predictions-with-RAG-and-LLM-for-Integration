The project demonstrated significant success in using RAG pipelines and LLMs for healthcare.

Accurate Predictions: Disease prediction models achieved >85% accuracy.
Relevant Chatbot Responses: RAG ensured responses were contextually aligned with user queries.
Patient Satisfaction: Early testing showed positive feedback for the chatbot’s interactive and accurate responses.

# Methodology
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Gathered comprehensive medical datasets from public repositories (e.g., UCI and Kaggle).
Preprocessed data to clean, normalize, and prepare it for predictive modeling.

2. RAG Framework for Context-Aware Responses
Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:
Retriever: FAISS-based vector store for storing and retrieving relevant medical documents.
Generator: LLaMA2 fine-tuned for domain-specific queries, ensuring context-aware and concise outputs.

3. Predictive Modeling
Used machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on health data for predictions.
Models focus on early detection of diseases based on patient symptoms and historical data.
4. AI Chatbot (MedBot)

Integrated LLM with natural language understanding (NLU) to build an intelligent chatbot.
Designed custom prompts for domain-specific accuracy. Example prompt:
Use the context provided to answer the user’s medical question. Do not generate responses outside the given data.  

5. Report Generation and Analysis
Automated generation of medical reports using patient input and predictive model results.
Reports include visualizations (charts and graphs) created using Power BI for comprehensive insights.

6. Streamlit Deployment
Built an interactive web interface for patients and healthcare providers using Streamlit.
Deployed the application via ngrok for public access during development.
