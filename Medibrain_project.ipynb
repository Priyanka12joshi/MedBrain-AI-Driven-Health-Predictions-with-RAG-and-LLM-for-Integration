      "\n",
      "Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs, a vital organ that allows us to breathe. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more deaths than colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is the most common type, accounting for about 85% of all lung cancers. SCLC is less common but more aggressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lung cancer usually starts in the cells that line the air passages of the lungs. These cells, known as epithelial cells, can become abnormal and grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor. The tumor can then spread to other parts of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact cause of lung cancer is not known, but it is strongly linked to smoking. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, and certain types of air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms of lung cancer can include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, shortness of breath, hoarseness, and unexplained weight loss. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to see a doctor right away. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve the chances of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment for lung cancer depends on the type, stage, and location of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention is key when it comes to lung cancer. If you smoke, quitting is the best thing you can do to reduce your risk of developing lung cancer. If you don't smoke, don't start. Avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, and other lung cancer risk factors can also help reduce your risk. Regular screenings for lung cancer may be recommended for certain high-risk individuals, such as current or former smokers.\n"
